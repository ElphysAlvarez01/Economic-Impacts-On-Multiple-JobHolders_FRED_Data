## Project Overview
> The labor market is constantly evolving, with an increasing number of individuals taking on multiple jobs. This phenomenon raises questions about the economic and social implications of such arrangements. This notebook aims to analyze data related to multiple jobholders, shedding light on trends, demographics, and the overall impact on the workforce.

## Data Sources
Analysis was conducted on Sept 2024 and all files were as of July 2024. 
>- **U..S Fred Data :** CPI, CPI Primary Rent & Owner Equivalent, Credit Card Delinquency Rates, Fed Fund Effective Rate, and Different Types of Multiple Job Holders. 

## Tools and Libraries Used

>- Python 3.x
>- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
>- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
>- **Matplotlib / Plotly:** For data visualization and trend analysis.

## Steps: 
### **A. Data Preparation:**
**Data Cleaning & Merging:**
- All files were inner merged with the 'DATE' column and combined with a starting date of January 1, 1994.
- The datetypes were kept the same because they provide valueable insights in their format. For example, changing the floats to intergers would change the results.
- There were no nulls found which is expected as this is usually a data source with clean data.  

### **B. Series of Analysis & Visualizations:**
